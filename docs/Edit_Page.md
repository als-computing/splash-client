# Page Viewing/Editing

[Tutorial on viewing and editing.](/tutorials/Edit_Page.html)
## Purpose
This page displays a specific document and its corresponding references for the purpose of viewing and editing. 

## Title
The title of the document will be at the top of the page. You can edit the title by double clicking on it, or clicking the pencil icon. 

## Metadata
In the upper right corner you can see a card that will display the date created and the creator. If the document has been edited then it will also display the date it was last edited at and the name of the person who edited it.

## View Past Versions
This button will take you to the ["Versioned view"](/Versioned_View.html) of this page.

## The Document
A white box displays the actual content of the document. To edit the document, double click anywhere inside the box, or click on the pen icon in the upper left corner of the document. Hovering over any parenthetical references in the document should display a small pop up next to the cursor that will contain the APA citation of the corresponding reference. Clicking on any in-text citations will bring you down to the specific citation in the ["Citations"](#citations) table.
 ## Editing The Document
 * ### Editor Toolbar
    The use of each button will be displayed by a tooltip if the the user hovers their mouse over the icon.
 * ### Insert Reference
    This button will open up the ["Insert Citation"](/tutorials/Insert_Citation.html) pop up.
* ### Save/Cancel
    The "Save" button will be disabled unless some change has been made to the document. The "Cancel" button will discard all changes made to the document since the last save.


## Saving With Conflicts
Sometimes when saving you will need to resolve a conflict. For more look at the [tutorial](/tutorials/Edit_Page.html#view-and-resolve-conflicts) on this.

## Citations 
This table is meant to display every citation that is referenced in the document. It displays the APA citation format. It essentially acts as a bibliography. The only way that these citations can be added or removed is by [editing the corresponding in-text citations.](/tutorials/Insert_Citation.html)

## Additional References
This table is meant to display other references, not directly cited in the text but that may be relevant to the document. These can be [removed and added](/tutorials/Additional_References.html) at will, unlike the "Citations" table.
