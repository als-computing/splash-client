## Citations 
This table is meant to display every citation that is referenced in the document. It displays the APA citation format. It essentially acts as a bibliography. The only way that these citations can be added or removed is by [editing](/tutorials/Insert_Citation.html) the corresponding in-text citations.

## Additional References
This table is meant to display other references, not directly cited in the text but that may be relevant to the document. These can be [removed and added](/tutorials/Additional_References.html) at will, unlike the "Citations" table.
