# Login to the site
For now, a user _must_ be logged in to the site in order to see/edit any of the content. The user must have been pre registered by a system admin. There is currently no way of creating an account. This login can only happen through a google account.

1. Navigate to https://mwet.lbl.gov/login. If you are already logged in, this will navigate you to the home page.
2. Click the blue "Sign in with Google" button. This will open a pop up window.
3. Sign in to or choose the google account that you have been pre-registered with.
4. If the account is not registered with the system you should get a dialog that states "Looks like you're not registered." Try using another google account, or contact the admins to ask if you are registered with the system.
