# Create a New Page
Let's say you want to create a new page in the system. For this example we'll pretend that we are creating a new compound.

2. Click on the "Compounds" card, or the "Compounds" link in the left of the black nav bar.
3. Click "Create Compound Page" in the upper right of the page.
4. Type in the title of the page and click "Create"
