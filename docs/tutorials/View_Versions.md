# View Versions of a Page

For this example we will pretend that we are viewing the versions of a Compound page.

1. Navigate to the <a :href="$page.VUE_APP_SPLASH_BASE" target="_blank">home page</a>.

2. Click on the "Compounds" card, or the "Compounds" link in the left of the black nav bar.
3. Click on the row for the compound you want to view in the table.
4. Click on the button that says "View past versions."
5. You will be presented with the most recent version.
6. You can use the numbered pagination toolbar to go back and forth between the different versions. The double arrows on either end of this bar will bring you to the most recent version (right arrow) or to the earliest version (left arrow). The single arrows will let you increment/decrement the version number you are viewing. 
7. Click on "Go back to editing" when you are done.
