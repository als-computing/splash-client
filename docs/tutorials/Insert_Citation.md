# Inserting In-text Citations
Sometimes you will want an in-text citation in your document. We can automatically generate these from just a DOI.
1. Place your cursor where you would like the citation to be inserted. Click on the button "Insert Reference."

2. You can search our database for citations that have already been added by other users. Click the plus button to the right of the citation in order to insert them.

3. If the citation does not exist in the database, you can copy paste the DOI of the wanted reference into the "Create a Reference" field.

4. Click "Find DOI" and this will search a third party database for this specific reference. It will display the reference info with a "Create" button, that will save this reference to the Splash database and insert it into the document.

5. If this reference already exists in the Splash database, you will be notified, it will display the citation and display an "Insert" button that will insert the citation into the document.

6. Finally, if the DOI cannot be found in the third party database then the dialog box will inform you of that.

7. When you click Save the APA citation should then show up in the "Citations" table
