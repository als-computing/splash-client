# Edit Existing Page

For this example we will pretend that we are editing a Compound.

1. Navigate to the <a :href="$page.VUE_APP_SPLASH_BASE" target="_blank">home page</a>.
2. Click on the "Compounds" card, or the "Compounds" link in the left of the black nav bar.
3. Click on the row for the compound you want to edit in the table.
4. Double click on the content box, or click on the pen icon in the upper left corner of the content box. If you want to edit the title, double click on it, or click the pen icon.
5. After editing the content click "Save" to save your changes (this may require you to resolve conflicts as described later in this page). If you wish to discard your changes click cancel.

## View and resolve conflicts

Sometimes while you are editing a document, another user may also edit the document and then save their changes before you do. In this case, when you save your changes a dialog will pop up notifying you of this and it will display a button that says "View their changes."

1. Click on "View their changes." You can now see the latest changes made to the document. Look carefully through the document and through the "Additional References" table. Consider how best you can combine both of the changes. 

2. You can always re-open this pop up window if you close it by clicking on the "View changes" button underneath the title.

3. After merging the changes and clicking the "Save" button. A dialog will pop up asking: "Are sure you have succesfully merged the two documents?" Clicking "No" will bring you back to your editing screen. Clicking "Yes" will save your changed to the document.

4. Don't worry if you make a mistake because every version of the document is saved. So if you realize you messed up, you can look at the version of the document that contains that user's edits.
